# Multi_Madness_Marksmen
This will be an FPS game with a lot of stuff to show.
we are still preparing the game.
Don't expect much it is our first project.
The character will be a cat with 3 types of guns.

- sniper rifle
- assault rifle
- shotgun

Currently, the game only offers a single-player option where the player has to shoot cats within a time limit. Once the time runs out, the player dies and their kills are displayed. 

How to play :

-When you open the game, select Play > Singleplayer.
-You then select the weapon you want (just click on it, if you don't select one it will automatically set to assault rifle).
-When your weapon is selected, click "esc" to enter or press the back button.
-In-game you will see your score, remaining time, and ammo stats.
-The game starts after you kill your first enemy (the cat with the red hat).
-After each kill, another enemy will appear randomly on the map.
-When your time limit drops to 0, you will be eliminated and your score will be displayed.
-Now you can tell your friends how good you are or just play again.

Plans:

Adding a database for saving scores.
Adding multiplayer.
